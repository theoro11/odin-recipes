    <p>This clear broth seasoned with soy sauce seems very simplistic, but it belies the intense umami flavor within the soup. We use chicken and 4 types of dried seafood to create an incredibly savory broth that is seasoned with a soy sauce tare that gives the broth a bit of sweetness and wonderful complexity. The best thing about this recipe is that we use a pressure cooker that not only helps extract all the flavor very quickly but also creates a beautifully clear broth.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup dried scallops</li>
        <li>1 cup dried anchovies</li>
        <li>¼ cup dried shrimp</li>
        <li>¼ cup bonito flakes</li>
        <li>1 (1 inch) piece ginger, thinly slices, divided</li>
        <li>1 (4 inch) piece dashi kombu (dried kelp)</li>
        <li>3 quarts water</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken, scallops, anchovies, shrimp, bonito flakes, half the ginger, and kombu in an electric pressure cooker. Add water; close and lock the lid. Select the Soup setting; set timer for 90 minutes according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
        </li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Strain broth through a colander or fine-mesh sieve. Skim the fatty oil off the top of the broth.</li>
        <li>Combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, green onions, bonito flakes, sugar, garlic, and kombu in a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors blend, about 10 minutes. Strain tare sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 tablespoons of tare sauce into a large bowl. Ladle in about 2 cups of broth. Add 1/6 of the ramen noodles. Repeat with remaining tare, broth, and ramen.</li>
    </ol>
